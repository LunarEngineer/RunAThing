# Test your thing

When your thing does a thing, it better do the *right* thing.

Put whatever testing you feel is appropriate into the tests folder; remember that good testing is one of the most beautiful forms of art.

You may use fixtures to declare elaborate graphs of functionality
dynamically and collect information about the tests afterwards.
