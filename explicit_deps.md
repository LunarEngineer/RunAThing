# For posterity

In github actions I've used [actions/checkout@v4](https://github.com/actions/checkout).

This allows for checking out the repo to the local runner; it has advanced configuration available which will allow for specific, targeted, checkouts.

That allows for 'bare' checkouts to greatly reduce information accessed.
