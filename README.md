# RunAThing: Python

Regardless oh what you're testing in Python and where, theres a fairly reusable pattern.

add devcontainer and run build scripts in env to pre-build lightweight dev env.

add security, linting, others.

merge from main on update.

build setup.cfg and tests from core deps.

initial tox step builds packaging.

declare core deps

fork from this for specfic py ver. collect ci. publish results to data layer.

This branch, by itself, doesn't do anything.
